This website utilizes php and mysql. Unfortunately, we are unable to create a live website, therefore this is a localhost website, where we used xampp, to run Apache and Mysql to run a database and local website.

On top of that, we failed to implement the necessary functions due to technical difficulty. However, we successfully developed a model ready to perform prediction on whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Please go to https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Iz7sF-MdZCzTyLH2_TY0yTQlZizQ7FC/view?usp=sharing
run the python file , then proceed to the model.html to test out the prediction by entering the necessary and accurate data (refer the .csv file)
